## **Overview**
<div align="justify">
<p>
Despite the rapid advancement of financial technology, the management of charitable funds—including
Waqf, Zakat, and Sadaqah—continues to face significant challenges such as lack of transparency,
inefficiency in distribution, and limited accessibility. Many Waqf institutions, Zakat authorities, and
non-profits organisations still rely on outdated systems that hinder real-time tracking, smart fund
allocation, and donor engagement.
